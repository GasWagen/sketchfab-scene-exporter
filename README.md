sketchfab-dl-script
===================

A userscript to export .obj files from Sketchfab.com  

This script allows you to export a .OBJ file from a Sketchfab model by clicking the (script-generated) 'Download .OBJ' button to the right of the 'Model Request' button on the Sketchfab model viewer page.  

Installation:  
  You must install the userscript to see the 'Download .OBJ' button on the model viewer page.  
  I have tested the script so far on Tampermonkey (Chrome) and Greasemonkey (Firefox).
